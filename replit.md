# Overview

This is a Flask-based web application that processes and validates text files. The application allows users to upload .txt files containing structured data in the format "parte1:parte2:parte3" (three colon-separated parts). It validates each line against this pattern, accumulates valid lines across multiple file uploads, and provides functionality to download the processed results as a consolidated file.

The application features a Bootstrap-styled dark theme interface with file upload capabilities and real-time feedback on processing results.

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

# System Architecture

## Web Framework
- **Flask**: Lightweight Python web framework chosen for its simplicity and rapid development capabilities
- **Template Rendering**: Uses `render_template_string` for inline HTML templating, avoiding the need for separate template files
- **Session Management**: Configured with environment-based secret key for session security

## File Processing Architecture
- **In-Memory Storage**: Uses a global list (`all_lines`) to accumulate valid lines across multiple uploads
- **Validation Logic**: Implements a dedicated `linha_valida()` function that checks if lines follow the expected "parte1:parte2:parte3" pattern
- **File Handling**: Processes uploaded files by reading content as UTF-8 text and splitting into lines

## Frontend Design
- **Bootstrap Framework**: Uses Bootstrap 5 with dark theme for responsive, modern UI
- **Font Awesome Icons**: Integrated for enhanced visual elements
- **Form Handling**: Multipart form encoding for file uploads with proper file type restrictions

## Data Flow
1. User uploads .txt file through web interface
2. File content is decoded and split into individual lines
3. Each line is validated against the three-part colon-separated pattern
4. Valid lines are accumulated in global storage
5. User can download consolidated results

## Storage Strategy
- **Upload Directory**: Creates local "uploads" folder for temporary file storage
- **Global State**: Maintains accumulated valid lines in application memory (note: this approach doesn't persist across application restarts)

# External Dependencies

## Python Packages
- **Flask**: Core web framework for HTTP handling and routing
- **os**: Built-in module for file system operations and environment variable access
- **logging**: Built-in module for application debugging and monitoring

## Frontend Libraries
- **Bootstrap 5**: CSS framework loaded from CDN (cdn.replit.com) with custom dark theme
- **Font Awesome 6.4.0**: Icon library loaded from cdnjs.cloudflare.com for UI enhancement

## Environment Configuration
- **SESSION_SECRET**: Environment variable for Flask session security (falls back to development default)
- **File System**: Relies on local file system for upload directory creation and file processing

## Browser Dependencies
- **Modern Browser Support**: Requires browsers that support HTML5 file input and Bootstrap 5 features
- **JavaScript**: Bootstrap components may require JavaScript for interactive elements
